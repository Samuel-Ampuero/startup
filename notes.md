## Github
It is _very_ confusing, but luckily the repo for the class explains everything there is to know about it: https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/essentials/gitHub/gitHub.md

## AWS
- Public IP for server = http://52.71.239.144
- ssh commands = âžœ  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@52.71.239.144
- GitHub = https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/amazonWebServicesEc2/amazonWebServicesEc2.md

## Amazon Web Services - Route 53

## Git Bash commands
The other primary purpose of the console is to execute commands. You already did this in the previous section when you executed commands for working with the file system. However, console commands can perform many different operations. Here are some basic commands that you show experiment with.

- **echo** - Output the parameters of the command
- **cd** - Change directory
- **mkdir** - Make directory
- **rmdir** - Remove directory
- **rm** - Remove file(s)
- **mv** - Move file(s)
- **cp** - Copy files
- **ls** - List files
- **curl** - Command line client URL browser
- **grep** - Regular expression search
- **find** - Find files
- **top** - View running processes with CPU and memory usage
- **df** - View disk statistics
- **cat** - Output the contents of a file
- **less** - Interactively output the contents of a file
- **wc** - Count the words in a file
- **ps** - View the currently running processes
- **kill** - Kill a currently running process
- **sudo** - Execute a command as a super user (admin)
- **ssh** - Create a secure shell on a remote computer
- **scp** - Securely copy files to a remote computer
- **history** - Show the history of commands
- **ping** - Check if a website is up
- **tracert** - Trace the connections to a website
- **dig** - Show the DNS information for a domain
- **man** - Look up a command in the manual

You can also chain the input and output of commands using special characters

- `|` - Take the output from the command on the left and _pipe_, or pass, it to the command on the right
- `>` - Redirect output to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists
- `>>` - Redirect output to a file. Appends if the file exists

For example, you can list the files in a directory, pipe it into `grep` to search for files created in Nov, and then pipe that into `wc` to count the number of files found with a date of Nov.

```
ls -l | grep ' Nov ' | wc -l
```

There are also keystrokes that have special meaning in the console.

- `CTRL-R` - Use type ahead to find previous commands
- `CTRL-C` - Kill the currently running command

### Comments

You can include comments in your HTML files by starting the comment with `<!--` and ending it with `-->`. Any text withing a comment block will be completely ignored when the browser renders it.

```html
<!-- commented text -->
```

### Special characters

HTML uses several reserved characters for defining its file format. If you want to use those characters in your content then you need to escape them using the `entity` syntax. For example, to display a less than symbol (`<`) you would instead use the less than entity (`&lt;`). You can also use the entity syntax to represent any unicode character.

| Character | Entity      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| &amp;     | `&amp;`     |
| <         | `&lt;`      |
| >         | `&gt;`      |
| "         | `&quot;`    |
| '         | `&apos;`    |
| &#128512; | `&#128512;` |

## HTML Input

| Element    | Meaning                          | Example                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `form`     | Input container and submission   | `<form action="form.html" method="post">`      |
| `fieldset` | Labeled input grouping           | `<fieldset> ... </fieldset>`                   |
| `input`    | Multiple types of user input     | `<input type="" />`                            |
| `select`   | Selection dropdown               | `<select><option>1</option></select>`          |
| `optgroup` | Grouped selection dropdown       | `<optgroup><option>1</option></optgroup>`      |
| `option`   | Selection option                 | `<option selected>option2</option>`            |
| `textarea` | Multiline text input             | `<textarea></textarea>`                        |
| `label`    | Individual input label           | `<label for="range">Range: </label>`           |
| `output`   | Output of input                  | `<output for="range">0</output>`               |
| `meter`    | Display value with a known range | `<meter min="0" max="100" value="50"></meter>` |

## Form element

The main purpose of the `form` element is to submit the values of the inputs it contains. Before JavaScript was introduced the `form` container element was essential because it was the only way for the browser to send the input data to a web server as part of a request to process the input and generate a new web page displaying the result of the input. With JavaScript we have much more control over input data and what is done with it. For example, in a single page application the JavaScript will dynamically rebuild the HTML elements to reflect the results of the user interaction. With this ability the data may not even be sent to the server. This greatly reduces the necessity of the `form` element, but it is often still used simply as a container. Just remember that you are not required to have a form element to use input elements.

Here is an example of a simple form that submits the value of a `textarea` element.

```html
<form action="submission.html" method="post">
  <label for="ta">TextArea: </label>
  <textarea id="ta" name="ta-id">
Some text
  </textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Pressing the submit button sends the following data to the web server. The browser generates the data by combining the textarea's `name` attribute with the current value of the textarea.

```
ta-id=Some+text
```

## Input element

From the very early days of HTML it contained elements for accepting the input of user data. These elements include the following:

| Element    | Meaning                          | Example                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `form`     | Input container and submission   | `<form action="form.html" method="post">`      |
| `fieldset` | Labeled input grouping           | `<fieldset> ... </fieldset>`                   |
| `input`    | Multiple types of user input     | `<input type="" />`                            |
| `select`   | Selection dropdown               | `<select><option>1</option></select>`          |
| `optgroup` | Grouped selection dropdown       | `<optgroup><option>1</option></optgroup>`      |
| `option`   | Selection option                 | `<option selected>option2</option>`            |
| `textarea` | Multiline text input             | `<textarea></textarea>`                        |
| `label`    | Individual input label           | `<label for="range">Range: </label>`           |
| `output`   | Output of input                  | `<output for="range">0</output>`               |
| `meter`    | Display value with a known range | `<meter min="0" max="100" value="50"></meter>` |

The input element represents many different input types. You set the type of input with the `type` attribute. There are several different types to choose from. This includes different flavors of textual, numeric, date, and color inputs.

| Type           | Meaning                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| text           | Single line textual value         |
| password       | Obscured password                 |
| email          | Email address                     |
| tel            | Telephone number                  |
| url            | URL address                       |
| number         | Numerical value                   |
| checkbox       | Inclusive selection               |
| radio          | Exclusive selection               |
| range          | Range limited number              |
| date           | Year, month, day                  |
| datetime-local | Date and time                     |
| month          | Year, month                       |
| week           | Week of year                      |
| color          | Color                             |
| file           | Local file                        |
| submit         | button to trigger form submission |

In order to create an input you specify the desired `type` attribute along with any other attribute associated with that specific input. Here is an example of a checked radio button and its associated label.

```html
<label for="checkbox1">Check me</label> <input type="checkbox" name="varCheckbox" value="checkbox1" checked />
```

Most input elements share some common attributes. These include the following.

| Attribute | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name      | The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form |
| disabled  | Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input                        |
| value     | The initial value of the input                                                      |
| required  | Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid                             |

The following shows what the inputs look like when rendered. Don't worry about how clunky they look right out of the box. We will fix that when we start styling things with CSS.
